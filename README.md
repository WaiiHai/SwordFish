The Ishikawa diagram is one of the main tools for measuring, evaluating, controlling and improving the quality of production processes.

Key Features:

  Adding/Changing a Main Goal.

  Adding/Removing/Changing Subgoals.

  For each subgoal there is a name, description, priority, deadline.

  The connection between subgoals occurs automatically when approaching each other.

  After the deadline has passed, the subgoal cannot be deleted/changed.

The project was completed in the 1nd year of university.
